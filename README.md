## ✅ How to Use This Repository

### 1. Search Before You Ask

* Use the **Issues tab** and search if your problem has already been reported/solved.
* Check both **Open** and **Closed** issues.
* Look for issues tagged with your current **week label** (e.g., `week-0`, `week-1`).

### 2. Filing a New Issue

When you create an issue:

* Choose the correct **Issue Template** (e.g., Technical Issue, Concept Doubt, Access Issue).
* Provide all required details (description, steps you tried, screenshots if any).
* Add the **week label** (e.g., `week-2`) so helpers know when it happened.

### 3. Labels & Tags

We use labels to keep everything organized:

* 📅 **Week Labels:** `week-0`, `week-1`, `week-2`, …
* ❓ **Question** – General doubt or clarification
* 🐞 **Bug/Technical Issue** – Errors, setup problems, broken tools
* 🔑 **Access Issue** – Login, registration, or permissions
* 🚩 **Urgent** – Needs quick attention
* ✅ **Resolved** – Already answered/solved

> 💡 Tip: Always attach the **week label** when you post your issue.

### 4. Finding Help

* Start by checking **Closed Issues** with the label for your current week.
* If you don’t find a solution, open a **New Issue**.
* Our support team will respond and assign the issue.

## 📌 Discussions

For general Q\&A, brainstorming, or sharing ideas:

* Use the **Discussions tab** instead of filing an issue.
